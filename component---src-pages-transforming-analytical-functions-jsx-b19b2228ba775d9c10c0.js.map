By creating small, high quality code libraries which can be re-used in new analytical projects, analysts can quickly assemble these ‘lego blocks’ into powerful new results using surprisingly little code, which in turn makes new work easier to understand. Since these ‘lego blocks’ are re-used in multiple projects, any improvements can result in widespread benefits.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The result is a sustained increase in analytical innovation.
