If our answers differed, I knew she would challenge me to explain why.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This was an effective technique because if my explanation was unconvincing, it probably meant either my model was wrong, or I didn’t understand it well enough to trust it.`}</p>\n    <p>{`I now think of her approach as a manual form of `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing\"\n      }}>{`integration testing`}</a>{` which is well-suited to analytical models. These ‘sense check’ tests are some of the most important tests of a model. They typically take the form of an expectation that a value within the model will fall between a plausible upper and lower bound. Re-imagined as automated test of analytical code, these checks can be applied all the way from low level calculations thorough to high level results to ensure that modelling results make sense and can be explained.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Because they test the answer rather than the details of the implementation, they have analytical meaning independently from the code. This means they can be written early on in the modelling process. They’re therefore capable of spotting errors earlier, increasing their value to the analyst.`}</p>\n    <p>{`They’re so valuable that I think that automating these sorts of tests should be a standard part of analytical quality assurance.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In contrast to technical-sounding ‘`}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing\"\n      }}>{`unit`}</a>{`’ and ‘`}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing\"\n      }}>{`integration`}</a>{`’ tests, analysts can readily see the value of automated ‘sense checks’, so they are easier to explain and more likely to be adopted. Presenting your results to your boss suddenly becomes much less scary if you know for sure your model isn’t doing anything crazy.`}</p>\n    <p>{`And more importantly, these ‘sense checks’ are likely to be more effective than many unit tests. It’s all too easy to descend into writing perfunctory unit tests, which are often the result of an analyst being told unit tests are necessary without understanding when and why they are valuable.`}</p>\n    <p>{`None of this is to say unit tests are not valuable when used effectively. They can be an important complement of sense checks, and at lower-layers of a model sense checks sometimes `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`are `}</em>{`unit tests.`}</p>\n    <p>{`By starting out with sense checks, analysts are introduced to a type of testing of their code which obviously improves the robustness of the modelling result. By considering why these tests have value, it should help them start to design other unit tests which are more valuable — favouring tests which have well-defined analytical meaning and are easy to maintain as the model evolves, and avoiding tests that offer little protection and get in the way of code re-factoring or model generalisation.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`An example`}</h3>\n    <p>{`The rest of this post is more technical.
